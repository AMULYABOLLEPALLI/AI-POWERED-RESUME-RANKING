# Resume-ranking
The increasing volume of job applications makes manual resume screening a time-consuming and inefficient process for recruiters. To address this challenge, this project presents an AI-powered Resume Screening System that leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to automate candidate shortlisting. The system processes resumes in various formats, extracts key features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and ranks candidates based on their relevance to job descriptions using Cosine Similarity. The implementation is done in Python, utilizing libraries such as Scikit-learn, streamlit, PyPDF2, pandas. A user-friendly interface is developed using Streamlit, making the system easily accessible. The results demonstrate an efficient and accurate shortlisting process, significantly reducing human effort while ensuring fairness and transparency in recruitment. This project contributes to the field of AI-driven recruitment systems by enhancing the hiring workflow and improving candidate-job matching efficiency.
